\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Context and Motivation}

In today's competitive business environment, human resources management plays a crucial role in organizational success. One of the most critical and challenging aspects of HR management is determining appropriate salary levels for employees. Traditional salary determination methods often rely on subjective assessments, industry standards, and negotiation, which can lead to inconsistencies and potential inequities.

The advent of machine learning and data analytics provides new opportunities to make this process more objective, transparent, and data-driven. By analyzing historical salary data and identifying patterns based on factors such as experience, education, position, and department, organizations can make more informed salary decisions.

\section{Problem Statement}

Organizations face several challenges in salary management:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inconsistency:} Different managers may apply different criteria when determining salaries
    \item \textbf{Lack of transparency:} Employees may not understand how their salaries are determined
    \item \textbf{Market competitiveness:} Ensuring salaries are competitive while maintaining budget constraints
    \item \textbf{Fairness:} Ensuring equal pay for equal work across different demographics
    \item \textbf{Forecasting:} Difficulty in predicting future salary budgets based on workforce changes
\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives}

The primary objectives of this project are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop a machine learning model capable of predicting employee salaries based on relevant features
    \item Create a user-friendly web application for HR professionals to access the prediction system
    \item Implement a complete employee management system integrated with the prediction engine
    \item Provide historical tracking of predictions for audit and analysis purposes
    \item Ensure the system is secure, scalable, and maintainable
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Literature Review and Theoretical Background}

\section{Machine Learning Overview}

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. In the context of salary prediction, supervised learning algorithms are employed where the model learns from historical data containing both input features (experience, education, etc.) and output labels (actual salaries).

\subsection{Supervised Learning}

Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data. The model learns to map input features to output labels, allowing it to make predictions on new, unseen data.

\subsection{Regression Analysis}

Salary prediction is a regression problem where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value (salary) based on input features. Unlike classification which predicts categories, regression predicts quantities.

\section{Machine Learning Algorithms}

\subsection{Random Forest}

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mean prediction of individual trees for regression tasks.

\textbf{Advantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Handles both numerical and categorical features
    \item Resistant to overfitting
    \item Provides feature importance measures
    \item Robust to outliers and noise
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mathematical Foundation:}

For a Random Forest with $T$ trees, the prediction for an input $x$ is:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{y} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} h_t(x)
\end{equation}

where $h_t(x)$ is the prediction of the $t$-th decision tree.

\subsection{XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)}

XGBoost is an optimized gradient boosting algorithm that builds models sequentially, with each new model attempting to correct the errors of the previous ones.

\textbf{Key Features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Regularization to prevent overfitting
    \item Handling missing values automatically
    \item Parallel processing for faster training
    \item Tree pruning for efficiency
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Objective Function:}

XGBoost minimizes the following objective function:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(\phi) = \sum_{i} l(\hat{y}_i, y_i) + \sum_{k} \Omega(f_k)
\end{equation}

where $l$ is the loss function and $\Omega$ is the regularization term.

\section{Web Application Development}

\subsection{Flask Framework}

Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that provides the essential tools for building web applications. Its simplicity and flexibility make it ideal for developing machine learning applications.

\subsection{Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture}

The MVC pattern separates application logic into three interconnected components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model:} Manages data and business logic
    \item \textbf{View:} Handles presentation and user interface
    \item \textbf{Controller:} Manages user input and updates model/view
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Collection and Preparation}

\subsection{Data Sources}

The training data consists of historical employee records including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Employee demographics (age, education)
    \item Work experience (years of experience)
    \item Job characteristics (position, department)
    \item Compensation (salary)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}

\subsubsection{Data Cleaning}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Data Cleaning Process}]
def clean_keys(df):
    # Convert Year and Month to numeric
    df["Year"] = pd.to_numeric(
        df["Year"].astype(str).str.strip(), 
        errors="coerce"
    )
    df["Month"] = pd.to_numeric(
        df["Month"].astype(str).str.strip(), 
        errors="coerce"
    )
    # Remove rows with missing values
    df = df.dropna(subset=["Year", "Month"])
    df["Year"] = df["Year"].astype(int)
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].astype(int)
    return df
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Feature Engineering}

Features are engineered to improve model performance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Encoding categorical variables (education level, position)
    \item Scaling numerical features (experience, salary)
    \item Creating interaction features
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Feature Scaling}

StandardScaler is applied to normalize numerical features:
\begin{equation}
    z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
\end{equation}

where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.

\section{Model Development}

\subsection{Random Forest Model}

\subsubsection{Model Configuration}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Random Forest Implementation}]
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Initialize model
rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(
    n_estimators=100,
    max_depth=10,
    min_samples_split=5,
    random_state=42
)

# Train model
rf_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Hyperparameter Tuning}

Key hyperparameters optimized:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{n\_estimators}: Number of trees
    \item \texttt{max\_depth}: Maximum tree depth
    \item \texttt{min\_samples\_split}: Minimum samples for split
\end{itemize}

\subsection{XGBoost Model}

\subsubsection{Model Configuration}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={XGBoost Implementation}]
import xgboost as xgb

# Initialize model
xgb_model = xgb.XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=6,
    random_state=42
)

# Train model
xgb_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Model Evaluation}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

\subsubsection{Mean Squared Error (MSE)}

\begin{equation}
    MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{R-squared Score}

\begin{equation}
    R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Cross-Validation}

K-fold cross-validation is employed to assess model generalization:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dataset split into K folds
    \item Model trained on K-1 folds
    \item Validated on remaining fold
    \item Process repeated K times
\end{itemize}

\section{Model Selection and Deployment}

The final model is selected based on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prediction accuracy on test set
    \item Generalization capability
    \item Computational efficiency
    \item Interpretability
\end{itemize}

Models are serialized using joblib for deployment:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Model Serialization}]
import joblib

# Save model
joblib.dump(rf_model, 'model.pkl')
joblib.dump(scaler, 'scaler.pkl')

# Load model
model = joblib.load('model.pkl')
scaler = joblib.load('scaler.pkl')
\end{lstlisting}
